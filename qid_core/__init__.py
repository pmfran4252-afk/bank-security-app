"""
QID Core: Quantum-Inspired Interference engine.

This package provides generic building blocks:
- Complex encoder
- FFT backend
- Amplitude masks
- Interference engine
- Signature extractor
- Pruner

To avoid import-time issues, callers should import concrete classes
directly from the submodules, e.g.:

    from qid_core.qid_complex_encoder import QIDComplexEncoder
